                <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get close to the equator.
                    To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeather API to assemble a data on 
                    over 500 cities.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs latitude.
                    Factors we looked as included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, humidity. This site provides the
                    source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions
                    of any trends and correlations witnessed.
